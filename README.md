# irccloud-to-xchat

This is a Rust program that converts IRC logs from the IRCcloud format to the XChat format. It uses the `zip` crate to extract the logs from a ZIP archive and write them to separate log files.

I have also formed a program to convert IRCCloud logs to the [Weechat](https://github.com/apple-fritter/logconvert.irccloud-to-weechat) format.

## Installation

1. Install Rust and Cargo on your system.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-irccloud-to-xchat-converter.git`
3. Navigate to the repository: `cd my-irccloud-to-xchat-converter`
4. Run the program: `cargo run`

## Usage

The program takes two arguments: the path to the input ZIP archive and the path to the output directory. Here's an example:

```bash
cargo run --release -- <input_zip> <output_dir>
```

Replace `<input_zip>` with the path to your input ZIP archive and `<output_dir>` with the path to the directory where you want to save the output log files.

### IRC usage considerations
When working with any project involving IRC (Internet Relay Chat), it's important to keep the following considerations in mind to ensure a positive and respectful environment for all participants.

#### Philosophy of Use
Tailor your project's behavior and responses to align with the expected norms and conventions of IRC. Take into account the preferences and expectations of IRC users, ensuring that your project provides a seamless and familiar experience within the IRC ecosystem.

#### Foster a Positive and Inclusive Environment
Respect and adhere to the guidelines and policies of the IRC platform you are using. Familiarize yourself with the platform's rules regarding script usage, automation, and acceptable behavior. Comply with the platform's Terms of Service, and be mindful of any limitations or restrictions imposed by the platform. Strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment where all users can engage respectfully and comfortably.

#### Respect the Rights and Dignity of Other Users
Maintain a polite and courteous demeanor in all interactions. Uphold the fundamental principles of respect, avoiding engagement in illegal, inappropriate, or offensive behavior. This includes refraining from using derogatory or inflammatory language, sharing explicit, triggering, or offensive content, engaging in harassment, or launching personal attacks. Obtain explicit consent before interacting with other users or sending automated responses. Respect the privacy of other users and avoid invading their personal space without their permission.

#### Respect the IRC Community and Channels
Avoid disrupting the normal flow of conversation within IRC channels. Ensure that your project's actions and responses do not cause unnecessary disruptions or inconvenience to other users. Implement mechanisms to prevent spamming or flooding the channel with excessive or irrelevant messages. Handle errors gracefully, preventing unintended behavior or disruptions to the IRC platform or the experiences of other users.

#### Ensure Compatibility
Consider the potential variations in behavior across different IRC platforms and clients. While aiming for compatibility, be aware that certain functionalities may not be available or consistent across all platforms. Test your project on multiple IRC platforms and clients to ensure compatibility and provide the best possible experience for users.
